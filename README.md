This is an experimental work.

the idea is:
- keep updated the media_tree from https://git.linuxtv.org/media_tree.git every hour...
- apply our patches to some different branches (vuplus-media-tree patch)
- rename few function to avoid conflicts with other modules
- prepare a scheduled (or updated on push) action to prepare a release of our branch to avoid on build time to download 2gb git of linux sources
